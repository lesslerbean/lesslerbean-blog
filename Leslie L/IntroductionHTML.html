      Hey everyone! My name is Leslie Lovell. I'm seventeen years old and I
      am making this blog for a couple of reasons. First off, I needed a place
      to escape to and to share my thoughts freely. Secondly, I had to do it as
      a school assignment. It fit my purposes. And finally, it just seems like
      fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, so a little bit about the site. I've got a couple different things
      going on. This, obviously, is the intro. It says at the top, for anyone
      who didn't notice. The other pages will include a journal of sorts, for
      all of you who are bored and want to know what goes on in my day to day
      life. It will probably be relatively private on here, and by "private" I
      mean that my immediate family won't be snooping around online to see if
      they can hunt down my digital journal. At least I hope not. Ah, I'm
      rambing. Oops. That happens more often than I'd like to admit,
      unfortunately. Anyway, the other pages, aside from the journal, will
      include a collection of recipes, a collection of DIY crafts I intend to
      undertake (along with information about how they turn out when I do), my
      experiences with coding, what I'm learning in school (which will be
      separate from my life journal because I want to keep my school life as far
      away from my home life as possible), an area for stress relief, and a
      collection of my various writings so I can get feedback from you guys.
      I'll update this if I decide to add more pages.
    </p>
